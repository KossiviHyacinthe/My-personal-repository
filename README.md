# My-personal-repository 
I am currently a second-year engineering student at International Institut of Water and Environmental (2iE). I am
passionate ðŸ¤Œ about web development, mobile development, cybersecurity, data analysis, and
machine learning. Since a young age, I have dedicated time to honing my skills in these areas
and exploring their flexible functionality.
